          <p className=' mt-4 '>
            As a home grown brand, we know our duties go beyond selling shoes. At Liberty, all our employees are members of the extended Liberty family. <br />We ensure healthy surroundings and non-discriminatory working condition for all Liberty employees. This is the reason why Liberty finds mention <br />in The Economic Times'Most Trusted Brands'survey as among the top 100 Brands in 2008.<br /><br />

            In a move to uplift the weaker sections of the society, The Sanjay Charitable Hospital at Karnal was set up to cater to the needs of those families <br />who have suffered the tragedy of losing their sole earning member. We have also made it an annual practice to felicitate the winners of the Republic<br /> Day Bravery Awards.<br /><br />

            Liberty feels it is greatly indebted to Mother Earth for all the resources that it has provided to us. Therefore all our manufacturing units- ‘Humantech’ <br />Centers, are environment-friendly with extensive green covers. This is also exemplified in the way the Karnal Round-about has been nurtured and<br /> maintained by us and has now become the city’s “Green Showpiece”.
